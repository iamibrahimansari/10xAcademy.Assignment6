            To find out if his reality is a physical or mental construct, Mr.
            Anderson, aka Neo, will have to choose to follow the white rabbit
            once more. If he's learned anything, it's that choice, while an
            illusion, is still the only way out of -- or into -- the Matrix. Neo
            already knows what he has to do, but what he doesn't yet know is
            that the Matrix is stronger, more secure and far more dangerous than
            ever before.

                    At the beginning of the first Matrix, Thomas Anderson is
                    just a regular computer programmer who secretly works as a
                    hacker named Neo, selling illegal programming to whoever
                    wants it. After being freed, however, Neo learns that he is
                    The One, an individual who has been prophesied to save
                    humanity from the Matrix. Throughout the trilogy, Neo
                    uncovers more details about the history of the Matrix and
                    eventually makes a deal with the machines to destroy the
                    rampant Smith program in exchange for a truce between them
                    and the humans. Even though Neo sacrificed himself to
                    destroy Smith, he is somehow alive in The Matrix
                    Resurrections.
